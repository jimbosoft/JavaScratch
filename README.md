# JavaScratch

A play zone for me where I do tutorials and on-ine test and whatever experimenting I feel like.
Does not use maven, spring or anything other then Java 8.

Can't imagine it would interest anybody other then me as it is all a bit of a jumble ... but I like it!

If you want an example of a maven/spring - boot web application goto my [springbootwebapp](https://github.com/jimbosoft/springbootwebapp)
